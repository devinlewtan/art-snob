## Overview

Since I've been stuck in my childhood bedroom for all of quarantine, I have started to dream up some fun, extravagant interior decorations for my future apartment. Problem is... I live in a shoebox and have no income! How will people know I have good taste with no expensive art on my walls? 

So... I created a virtual dream apartment game to satisfy anyone's desire to be surrounded by art that costs more than their  - the objective is to decorate your tiny, NYC apartment walls with high end art so people can know how **truly cultured** you are.
